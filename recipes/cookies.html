    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah, the humble chocolate chip cookie. Not only is it the greatest type of cookie in the cookie world, but also one of my favorite sweets of all time. This one is my ideal version.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (10g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (161g) firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp (9g) fine sea salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (168g) unsalted butter, melter</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp (10ml) pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups plus 1 tbsp (197g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp (2g) baking soda</li>
        <li>8 oz (225g) dark chocolate bar (about 70% cacao), roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Whisk in the butter in a slow stream until completely combined and emulsified.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the egg yolk, the whole egg, and the vanilla extract. Continue mixing until completely incorporated.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture. Gently mix together until just incorporated into a dough.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the over to 350 &deg;F (180&deg;C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>If the dough was in the refrigerator overnight, it may need to soften at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes so it's relatively pliable but still very chilled. Using a medium-sized ice cream scoop (3-4 oz), spoon 4large balls of dough onto 1 baking sheet at least 2 1/2 inches (6.25cm) apart. Repeat on the other baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake 1 sheet at a time for 13 to 15 minutes. When you have 10 minutes remaining in the bake time, pick up the sheet and gently drop it down onto the oven rack. (This will flatten the cookies slightly.) Repeat again when you have 7 minutes left, and once more when you have 3 minutes left. (This makes the cookies much chewier, fudgier, and richer.) Bake until the cookies are a light golden color on the outside but still slightly underbaked on the inside.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and cool copmletely on a wire rack. Enjoy! Store leftovers in an airtight container on the counter for up to 1 week.</li>
